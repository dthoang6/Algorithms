/* S1:Problem Details, key points 

*/

/* S2: Ask questions to confirm, double check input, output 

*/

/* S3: what is the most important value, main goal of the problem? time, space, readable 

*/

/* S4: Gather enough assumption to start solve problem 

*/

/* S5: Easy, brute force solution: first solution 

*/

/* S6: Explain why brute force solution is not optimal based on BigO

*/

/* S7: Try to improve the brute force solution: bottle neck, repeat code,
common patterns 

*/

/* S8: Explain your new approach, walk through your code, steps you are going to
follow. 

*/

/* S9: Modularize your code from the very beginning 

*/

/* S10: Start coding: 
-write something, and start with the easy parts 
-a lot of interviewers ask questions that your won't be able to fully answer on time.
-how can I show that I can think, and working toward a solution.
-break things up in function, makeup a function
-------

*/

/* S11:Error check by breaking the code
-never make assumption about input
-always check for false inputs that you don't want
-comment in your code, the checks that you want to do
-tell the interviewer that you would write tests now to make function fail
----

*/

/* S12: Test your code
-check for no parameters, 0, undefined, null, massive inputs, async code...
-ask the interviewer if we can make assumption about the code.
-Can I make the answer return an error?
-Am I repeating chunk of code ---> Functions
----

*/

/* S13: Talk to interview where you would improve the code
-Does it work?
-Are there different approach?
-Is it readable?
-What would you google to improve?
-How can performance be improved
-What was the most interesting solution?
